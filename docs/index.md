fastack is an intuitive framework based on FastAPI, for creating clean and easy-to-manage REST API project structures. It's built for FastAPI framework ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Why did I make this?

I'm the type of person who doesn't want to repeat the same thing over and over again. So i made this üòÖ

In my opinion, when you use a framework that doesn't have a project generator. You need to search or create your own project structure, Of course this will take time. I just want you to only focus on business logic. Not to be confused by sometimes ambiguous project structures, lacking plugins to support development, etc.
